  "summary": "Docs and video slide components were updated to reference video1.mp4/video2.mp4 with improved graceful playback handling and to document asset setup. However, no actual static media files (photos, videos, birthday.mp3) were added to the public root in this diff, and ASSET_SETUP.md includes extra filename mappings not requested.",

      "requirement": "Add the 4 user-uploaded images to the app’s static public root and map them to the exact filenames required by Slide 2: photo1.jpg–photo4.jpg (no folder paths), using the provided source files in order.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no new files added under a public root (no added files at all). Only documentation and TSX changes are present, so the required images cannot be confirmed as integrated/served at /photo1.jpg–/photo4.jpg from this diff.",

      "reason": "The diff updates Slide3/Slide4 to reference filename-only sources and adds documentation, but does not add video1.mp4 or video2.mp4 to the repository/public root (no added files), so inclusion in build/deployment is not implemented in this diff.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-21 only asks to document the mapping for the four uploaded photo filenames to photo1.jpg–photo4.jpg, and to reiterate required filenames for video1.mp4, video2.mp4, and birthday.mp3.
